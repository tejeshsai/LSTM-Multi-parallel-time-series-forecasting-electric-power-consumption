# LSTM-Multi-parallel-time-series-forecasting-electric-power-consumption
This repository includes code for multi-parallel-time-series for the eletric power consumption dataset.

The dataset used in this repository : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set
It's a text file. Place it under input folder. The input folder and the ipynb file should both be in the same directory.

There are a lot of tutorials on how to build up LSTM model but there is a little resource on predicting and as well as forecasting multiple
parallel time series. 

Necessary libraries required : Tensorflow, pandas, sklearn, numpy 
Should have anaconda jupyter notebook installed to run.

We hope you like this small project!
